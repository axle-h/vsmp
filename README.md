# Very Slow Movie Player

A typical movie is played at 24fps, in 16 million colours over a couple of hours.
The very slow movie player will play a movie at 30 frames **per hour** in 2-colours over days, weeks, months.
I'm not planning to sit back with my popcorn and actually watch a movie on this thing. 
Instead, think of it as an attempt to create something interesting enough to be displayed from some very compromised, low power hardware.
I think that, mounted in a nice frame you could almost call it *art*.
Imagine the legendary Jack Rabbit Slim scene from Pulp Fiction slowly being revealed over a couple of weeks - the
uncomfortable silence literally lasting an entire day. Epic.
